## User Journey

A brave warrior enters their name and some personality traits and is returned the name of the glan they belong to. Glans are calculated based upon personality and each has a unique character.

The user feels a sense of accomplishment being grouped with others into a glanourous glan! Hoorah!

## Things We Learnt

- How to build an SQL DB

- How to return the results in a new table

## Problems We Had

- Communication: understanding what our goals were, what was involved in the project, agreeing on what the project should contain. We were often in agreement about decisions but weren't able to communicate this.
- Understanding Get/Post to the DB
- Did not prevent script injections but looked at FAC16's code and found you can use a \$ so that you can use a variable name instead. It was very interesting to learn about.
- Testing the DB
